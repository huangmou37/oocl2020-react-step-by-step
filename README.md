# React step by step

## Requirement
* create a react project, and do all practices in the project.
* one git commit one practice
* for every practice, please paste both commit url and screenshot of browser in remark practice by practice.

## Practices
1. please modify only ```index.js``` to let browser show a ```Hello world!``` button
2. please revert change of ```index.js``` and modify only ```App.js``` to let browser show a Hello world! button and text ```number: 0``` aside the button.
3. As a User, when I click the ```Hello world!``` button, then I can be alerted with ```now you know how to handle onclick event```
4. As a User, when I click the ```Hello world!``` button, then I can see the text ```number: 1``` instead of ```number: 0```.
5. ```App``` component can accept default number.
6. ```App``` component can accept a function to define what would happen when button is clicked. e.g.(App will increase number by 2 on every button click)
7. Extract ```number:``` into new Number component. (src/components/Number.js)
8. Add ```Line``` Component, and repeat ```Line``` according to number.
